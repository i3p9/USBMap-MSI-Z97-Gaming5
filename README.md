It is recommend to use the generated SSDT rather than `USBMap.kext`. 

Pre-requisite:

 - Acpi patch: `EHC1 to EH01` and `EHC2 to EH02`
 - USBInjectAll.kext 

`USBInjectAll.kext` is not required if generated `USBMap.kext` is used.

Notes: Mapped out my ports below in case anyone wants to create their custom SSDT.
